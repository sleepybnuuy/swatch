# Swatch

a Dalamud server info bar plugin to display swatch internet time.

adds the current .beat to the DTR-bar with minimal styling options. each .beat is 86.4 seconds long, with 1000 .beats in a day - allowing for global coordination without timezone concerns. for more info on the history of internet time, see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time).

inspired by Phantasy Star Online - never miss a divine punishment window again
